            <p>hi, welcome to my site. it's still in development and i'm still learning
                so some things might look off or be weird. 
                i'm happy to recieve any feedback if you don't like it !
            </p>
            <p>i'm <u>maidmage</u>, <u>glockmage</u>, <u>marn</u>, any of these names are work.</p>
            <p>i'm currently majoring in computer science. 
                i spend a lot of my freetime studying game development, 3D modeling, pixel art, 
                music production, among other things.</p>
            <p>this site is a place for me to organize these several personal studies,
                and showcase all the lil' projects they've got me making
            </p>
            <p>make sure to checkout the blog section, which will be updated
                semi-regularly, as any notable progress is made 
                (or when i make something that gets me excited)
            </p>
            <p>thanks for visiting :)</p>
