                <p>
                    
                    This project is still in active development. Unlike the rest of the
                    projects that are in this post, this one is being developed as a team. 
                    Development started as part of Brackeys' Spring 2023 Game Jam.
                    Unfortunately however, due to improper planning and blame that I will
                    take full responsibility for, we did not have a compiled version uploaded
                    at the due date. The discord bot for late submissions also broke during the
                    grace period, which we assumed we could use. In the end our submission was
                    denied.
                </p>
                <p>Despite this, development continues.</p>
                <p>
                    The main idea wasn't very unique, it was going to be a game where you
                    played as an astronaut on a foreign planet. On that planet you would fight aliens,
                    harvest materials, and construct machines. These machines would then help 
                    you gather more resources, and the cycle would continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was particularly inspired by the unreleased game 
                    <a href="https://novalandsgame.com/">Nova Lands</a>. 
                    There's a free demo available right now, which I played a few weeks prior to
                    the game jam. Nova Lands showed me that you could make a resource gathering / base-builder 
                    that was intuitive and simple. The game didn't need extensive text descriptions,
                    youtube tutorials, or a wiki window open to understand. The key to me was how
                    straight-forward the progression in that demo was, and the fact that it didn't
                    contain a million different systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So a lot of my initial pitches I gave to the team were based on that demo.
                    Afterwards we threw in a good chunk of Factorio into the mix, and we had
                    our gameplan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My responsibilites on the project varied quite a bit. For this project, I was
                    the team's only art guy. Pretty much all of the art, save for anything that got
                    through the cracks, was made entirely by me. 
                    This also includes animations and music. I was also responsible for a portion of
                    the gun code, some tweaks to enemy behaviors, 
                    and a tiny bit of my initial UI code still exists, although it has been mostly
                    overwritten.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently we're preparing for a considerably large update, although
                    development is much more spotty now that the jam is over. The whole team is made 
                    up of college students, so we have other priorities to take care of. We can't do 
                    full time. So right now it's mainly just me and Joseph Roussos for the time being.
                    Casey Wohlers is talking to us still, but he's not able to dedicate any of
                    his time personally. Wohlers was responsible for a majority of the major technical
                    systems. He's been helping out Roussos in refactoring the inventory system, 
                    which has been the focus of most post-launch work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me personally, I've got a lot of different things to clear through
                    in the coming months. Hopefully this update can launch by the end of May 2023,
                    which is my target date I think, and then I plan on leaving the project
                    alone for some time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My tasks for the update are (mostly) as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lighting Rework</li>
                        <li>Environment Redesign</li>
                        <li>Advanced Enemy Behavior</li>
                        <li>A New Boss</li>
                        <li>Quest System</li>
                        <li>Ending Cutscene Update</li>
                        <li>Various other mini-mechanics & items</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work I've gotten so far focuses on the Boss, Lighting, and Environment Redesign.
                    I talk more about the specifics for these goals in the another post that will
                    be published at the same time as this one.

                <p><h2> Untitled Randomly Generated Chamber FPS </h2></p>

                <p>
                    This is the project I have the least to discuss about
                    right now because I'm picturing it mostly as a technical
                    demo more than anything. It's built on the base of the 
                    "untitled multiplayer arena game", which has a lot of stuff
                    going on technically. I wanted to just focus on the core 
                    aspects of that game, the movement controller, gunplay, 
                    and some animations, and box them off from multiplayer, 
                    replay systems, and a bunch of other stuff planned for the
                    other project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So right now the only idea I have running into it is 
                    creating a system for generating randomized chambers
                    into random positions, similar to the non-open world levels of 
                    <a href="https://www.warframe.com/landing">Warframe</a>.
                    These chambers will then be populated by AI, and you will 
                    quite simply just go from chamber to chamber and survive 
                    for as long as possible. I could make other objectives, 
                    a story, purpose, etc, but that goes against the whole point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project exists to be a smaller project for myself. It is there 
                    so that I can push a game all on my own. Other target goals include 
                    3D animation and 3D modeling. Any unique gameplay, mechanics, etc,
                    those can come later.

            <p><h2> untitled multiplayer arena game </h2></p>
            
            <p>
                This project was meant to span at least a full year. 
                I wanted to make a multiplayer arena game of some kind. I also wanted
                to cram as many crazy mechanics as possible, something akin to
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvC67kmYxPA&ab_channel=AkshonEsports">GunZ: The Duel</a>, or Smash Bros Melee.
                There's a lot of franchises that have removed tech or glitches/exploits for being unfair, or 
                for being unfriendly to casual players. Rest in peace, Bunnyhopping. I'm interested in seeing what a game built with these 
                mechanics in mind would look like, with a developer who isn't concerned about balance.
                I won't talk too much about that stuff until it's being developed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project has got me on a little study of movement controllers, the different kinds that exist in Unity.
                I'm not entirely sure what is best for what I'm working on yet, but I 
                might end up having to rework what currently exists. I'm not sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as actual development goes, I've used this project to get myself
                familiar with ProBuilder. I remade most of Dust2's A site (from Counter-Strike),
                and then added some elements of other maps here and there to create a very 
                unique, but entirely stolen, layout that itches some weird part of my brain the right way.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have worked on a rudimentary Replay System, but that's going 
                to need some reworks. I might discuss more about it in another post 
                down the line once I touch it up, but most of what I would talk about now
                can be found inside of this youtube video down below.
            </p>
            <p> 
                As far as multiplayer solutions go, I think it would be smart of me to
                make a smaller scale project, purely focused on networking first, 
                before attempting to make something for this game. There's a lot 
                that I don't quite understand yet, but the idea of working on those 
                things I dont know is actually really exciting.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Anyways, thats about it as far as currently active projects go.
                So I'll likely be posting about some of these as time goes on, 
                but it's also equally likely that some get dropped, put on hiatus,
                or disappear into the void or something.
